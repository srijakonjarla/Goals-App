Our app’s main goal is to keep the user accountable for their daily tasks by allowing the user’s friends and peers to keep 
them motivated and responsible for their tasks throughout the day. We decided to steer this concept in a way that users can 
keep their friends informed on what tasks they are able to accomplish throughout their day. There is a massive user base for 
our app because people all over the world constantly try to use the time in their day as efficiently as possible. There are 
productivity apps such as Google Calendar that are helpful in organization of tasks and responsibilities, but there is no way 
to hold users accountable for completion of work. Our app, #Goals will similarly help with organization, but users will be more 
encouraged to complete tasks due to the competitive system between users in groups. There are many apps on the Google Play 
Store that focus on productivity such as Forest and Productivity Challenge Timer, but these apps only allow users to enter in 
their todo lists or allot a chunk of time just for productive work. The app “Forest” currently allows users to stay productive 
by trying to keep a virtual tree alive. Everytime the user picks up their phone the tree begins to wither away. Additionally, 
the app “Todoist” allows users to enter in tasks needed to be completed everyday but doesn’t allow for any friendly competition 
to keep the user accountable for their work. When a first time user opens the app, they are able to register for a Goals 
account. A returning user can login to access the app. The user can then connect with friends using an email address. The main 
use of this app is to organize a to do list which a user can begin to do immediately. Then users can start completing tasks. 
For proof of completion, the user must upload a picture, or check in at a location. For example a user can check in at the gym. 
After proof is uploaded, the users friends can see that one has actually completed the task.
